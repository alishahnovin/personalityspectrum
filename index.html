		<p><strong>Communication is hard.</strong></p>
		<p>Most don't know that <em>different personalities prefer different styles of communication</em>.</p>
		<p>Maybe you like passionate explanations, appeals to your emotions, data-driven facts - or maybe, you don't want the explanation - you just want to be told what needs to be done.</p>
		<p>We also get motivated in different ways: Maybe you are self-motivated, socially-motivated, externally-motivated - or maybe, you get motivated through disagreement.</p>
		<p>Knowing these differences help us navigate the different personalities.</p>
		<p>An easy system to help is to divide personality types into colors.</p>
		<p>Each color has particular traits, and it is helpful to understand how these traits work. It helps to psychologically understand people better, and also help your interactions.</p>
		<p>There is no "best" color - and the truth is, our colors change depending on circumstances.</p>
		<p>Knowing our baseline helps us know ourselves, and know how to navigate people who we otherwise just don't understand.</p>
		<p>What follows are a set of terms. Rank them in order that most represents who you are. Some may be harder than others - that's ok. The important thing is you do your best to be honest with yourself.</p>

Red Dominant personalities prefer being leaders, or active and visible roles. They are confident and express pride in their work. The way they communicate will get them the spotlight (without actively seeking it.) CEOs, Politicians, Coaches are 'red dominant' because they are decisive, and want to take action. They are specific and direct with language.|Yellow Dominant personalities are expressive and in-touch with their emotions (not to be confused with "being emotional.") They enjoy brainstorming, and being around others. They crave the spotlight and like being complimented for their creativity and ideas. Being isolated is more of a challenge, and when they're in groups they can sense when someone is unhappy. When they lead, they like for everyone to understand the purpose and meaning for what is being done.|Blue dominant personalities are data-driven deep thinkers. They are analytical and precise. They may be more introverted - but more specifically, they prefer to have their space in order to focus. They are very organized, punctual and methodical. They take fewer risks because they care about data and patterns. They may either outright dislike or completely avoid arguments that touch on emotions and feelings, and just want facts. This may sometimes create the impression they are "cold" but the reality is they are adept at separating emotion from action. They are very logical and deliberate.|Green dominant personalities internalize their passion. They are patient and prefer to operate with structure and clear guidelines. They generally prefer to have expectations clearly laid out. They prefer to be part of strong teams but don't always seek to lead - however, they appreciate recognition for their specific contribution. They prefer their own environment and space (though not necessarily solitude.) They are easy to get along with and are social yet introverted. They are understanding and agreeable, and great facilitators. They are reasonable and aid through conflict. They don't want to be the reason something is held up, and so are inclined to sacrifice how they feel in order to help things move forward. They take their time prefer a democratic approach, seeking consensus. They like to read people and can detect insincerity.|Purple dominant personalities enjoy leadership but in an indirect way. They like to "save the day" and like to surprise people with results. They may not always discuss their thoughts until the end of a discussion, or may not discuss what they are working on until it's ready to see. Reactions are important to them. They dislike doing things the same way. They like to break the status quo, and find new and disruptive ways. They like to be bold and ambitious, and tell it like it is. Sometimes they may overstep. They seek affirmation but do so subtly. They want their work to be appreciated but are also humble. They like to take a rebel approach - they don't like to be given specific instructions on how to do things, and prefer to find their own path. In fact, they may have knee jerk reactions or struggle when told exactly what to do. They enjoy being in groups, enjoy being social, but may create the impression of being absent.`

They don't need parameters because they are confident their own parameters will more than suffice. Their motivation is internal, and they express it outwardly.|Knowing the parameters may help them, but parameters should be tied to a sense of purpose. Their motivation comes from the outside and they show it outwardly.|Their motivation is external, and they internalize it. Knowing the parameters is important because it's how they measure success.|They appreciate parameters, but mostly feel it will help everyone else. Their motivation comes internally, and stays internal.|They don't want parameters. If they know of the parameters, they'll try to shake them up, find flaws, or find a different set of parameters. Their motivation comes from the external, but with a twist: They use it as a recipe for what <em>not</em> to do. Their motivation is mostly internal, but externalizes when showing the results they've produced.`

Ambiguity. Wafflers. Don't be vague. Don't ramble on. They value time, so be careful about wasting there's. Red Dominants separate relationships from action. Don't take what they say personally, don't stray from purpose. Avoid irrelevant questions. They are natural leaders and like to be in control.|Having their opinions suppressed, emotions ignores, or not being taking seriously. They have a high EQ, and are very social. They don't like people being impersonal, business-like or task orientated. Don't inhibit their creativity, or appear aloof or detached.|Disorganization. Try not to be late as they are sticklers for time keeping. Try not to be flippant or pushy with them. They don't like vagueness so make sure you have lots of detail and be prepared to have lots of questions thrown at you. Don't use testimonials or exaggerate claims as they do not fall for this, they are more facts and figures orientated. Avoid emotional arguments, as they will avoid emotions.|Insincerity. Don't be pushy or put them on a spot. Don't dominate the discussion or rush things. Avoid deciding for them. Don't be abrupt. Do not make wild claims, sensationalize or embellish.|Very specific instructions. Details that don't allow them to express their creativity/rebellious nature. Doing things the same way. Not being given the room to experiment and try new things. Dislike not seeing reactions to results they produce.

Be succinct and precise, give facts, and avoid detail, avoid narratives, avoid subjectivity. Focus on results and outcomes, they need to hear this to make quick decisions. Use their time efficiently, they are fast paced thinkers and tend to move quickly in their thoughts. They are great people to bounce ideas off, but want people to do their own prep-work.|Be present. Socialize before mentioning any business. Be sure to address their feelings, passion, motivations and purpose. Brainstorm, talk about options. Be enthusiastic and energetic when conveying your ideas over to them and be fast paced in delivering them. Offer your ideas and importantly use humor when doing so being sociable and acknowledge their input. Make them feel appreciated. Externalize your praise.|Be well prepared, get into detail as they love to get all the facts in their mind. Be factual, specific and logical with your approach. Listening is important too. Listen carefully to what they have to say, as they verbalize their thoughts through questioning thoroughly. Give them time to respond and respect their silence. Be formal in your approach as they are very businesslike.|Be friendly and show genuine interest. Chat before going into business. It is important to develop trust first, be informal and nonthreatening. However, be alert for non-verbal signs of concern, remember they say yes but may mean no. Their body language will make this clear. If you notice any non-verbal signs, uncover their needs with open questions. Allow them to weigh things up for themselves.|Express the challenges and difficulty, provide your thoughts but give them space to be creative. When they tell you their ideas, show appreciation for their ideas - and be careful if their idea has already been tried. Don't be dismissive, but be supportive. They are brainstormers and want to surprise you with results.
